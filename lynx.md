====

lynx is a tui web browser that happens to support gopher protocol.

## `lynx` Keybindings

```
	q	quit lynx
	g	open url
	G	edit url
	left arrow	last page (go back) 
	right arrow	follow link
	up arrow	previous link
	tab	next link
	space	next page
	?	help # follow "Key-stroke Commands"
	/	search a string
```

## Dark Theme Configuration

Make an alias to `lynx -lss lynx.lss`. You can find a copy of `lynx.lss`
in notes directory.

## Gopher

To browse gopher, use complete gopher url. Otherwise `lynx` defaults to
http.

`curl` also supports gopher.
